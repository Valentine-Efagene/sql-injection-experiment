- Set UP
  1. Set up MySQL
  2. If using XAMPP, the files should be in a folder named 'injection'
  3. Have a user 'root', with no password (default), or set up account details as you wish, and update db.php file accordingly
  4. Use the injection entries in command.md
  5. Create DB test, or setup with db.php (create a DB to match the name you provide in db.php)
  6. Create table users in the DB created in step 4
  7. Happy hunting!
